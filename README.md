# Inflation

This is a JUCE based audio plugin to mimic a particular inflator plugin.

You will have to install JUCE and Xcode to try to compile this into usable AU or VST3. 

I will not publish compiled AU or VST3.

It is my first attempt to code for audio plugin. 

The band spilt does not seem to be sounding good yet.
